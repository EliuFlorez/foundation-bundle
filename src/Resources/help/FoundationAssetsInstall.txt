The <info>%command.name%</info> command installs bundle assets into a given
directory (e.g. the <comment>public</comment> directory) and some extra stuff for the foundation bundle:
executes 'npm install' and moves some files from the bundle assets to the given directory.

  <info>php %command.full_name% public</info>

A "bundles" directory will be created inside the target directory and the
"Resources/public" directory of each bundle will be copied into it.
